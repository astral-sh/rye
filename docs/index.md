# Rye: An Experimental Package Management Solution for Python

Rye is [Armin's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) personal one-stop-shop for all
his Python needs.  It installs and manages Python installations, helps working with
`pyproject.toml` files, installs and uninstalls dependencies, creates and updates
virtualenvs behind the scenes.  It supports monorepos and global tool installations.

Rye is an experimental endeavour to build a new type of packaging experience to
Python inspired by `rustup` and `cargo` from Rust.  It's **not yet production ready**
but feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
