# Syncing and Locking

Rye currently uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to download and install
dependencies.  For this purpose it creates two "lockfiles" (called `requirements.lock` and
`requirements-dev.lock`).  These are not real lockfiles but they fulfill a similar purpose
until a better solution has been implemented.

Whenever `rye sync` is called, it will update lockfiles as well as the virtualenv.  If you only
want to update the lockfiles, then `rye lock` can be used.

## Lock

When locking, some options can be provided to change the locking behavior.  These flags are
also all available on `rye sync`.

### `--update` / `--update-all`

Updates a specific or all requirements to the latest and greatest version.  Without this flag
a dependency will only be updated if necessary.

```
rye lock --update-all
```

### `--features` / `--all-features`

Python packages can have extra dependencies.  By default the local package that is installed
will only be installed with the default features.  If for instance you have an extra dependency
this will only be installed if the feature is enabled.

```
rye add --optional=web flask
rye lock --features=web
```

When working with workspaces, the package name needs to be prefixed with a slash:

```
rye lock --features=package-name/feature-name
```

The `--features` parameter can be passed multiple times and features can also be comma
separated.  To turn on all features, the `--all-features` parameter can be used.

```
rye lock --all-features
```

### `--pre`

By default updates and version resolution will not consider pre-releases of packages.  If you
do want to include those, pass `--pre`

```
rye lock Flask --pre
```

## Sync

Syncing takes the same parameters as `lock` and then some.  Sync will usually first do what
`lock` does and then use the lockfiles to update the virtualenv.

### `--no-lock`

To prevent the lock step from automatically running, pass `--no-lock`.

```
rye sync --no-lock
```

### `--no-dev`

Only sync based on the production lockfile (`requirements.lock`) instead of the development
lockfile (`requirements-dev.lock`).

```
rye sync --no-dev
```
